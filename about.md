I am freelance developer. I code in several technologies - *Android, Phonegap, PHP, Wordpress, AngularJS, Shopify, Opencart*, to name a few. Even if I am a total noob at something, I have this *jump in* attitude to start from scratch and begin code right away. This is what makes me confident in what I do.

Few of my freelance profiles:

- [Upwork Profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010129f0fb58a128b2)
- [Elance Profile](http://elance.com/s/sid2k7in)

Done around 80 projects in all, I consider myself comfortable enough to ask for a job. I prefer to work in a professional environment, which will also allow me to do more teamwork and the opportunity to do collaborative works, to which sir, I would like you to **HIRE ME**

If you need any programmatic work done, or a script that does something, Feel free to contact me anytime. I am available.
