Since it would take more than one post to share how to implement XMPP client in android, I made a series post which would explain in better way, the structure of XMPP client. I have tried to keep the code modular such that any part can be reused in any other application. The actual code for whole application can be found at [https://github.com/ashutosh2k12/XmppDemo](https://github.com/ashutosh2k12/XmppDemo)
